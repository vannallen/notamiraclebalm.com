                        <h2>elders and sisters, we've got you covered</h2>
                        <p>look, we know missionary life is hard enough without your face betraying you in every zone conference photo. that's why we're offering a special rebate for current and returned missionaries.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>here's the deal:</strong> buy any balm at full price, fill out this form, and we'll send you back $5. it's not much, but it's honest. and honestly, that's more than most companies will do for you.</p>
                        
                        <h3>who qualifies?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>currently serving missionaries (any mission, any country)</li>
                            <li>returned missionaries (honorably released, obviously)</li>
                            <li>mission presidents and their families (because you're doing the lord's work too)</li>
                            <li>anyone who can prove they've been to the mtc (even if it was just for a tour)</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>what you need:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>your mission call letter (or a photo of it)</li>
                            <li>your mission name and dates served</li>
                            <li>proof of purchase (receipt, order confirmation, etc.)</li>
                            <li>a selfie with your balm (optional, but we'd love to see it)</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><em>note: this rebate is not available to anyone who served in the "mission impossible" or "mission to mars" missions. we're looking for real missions here, people.</em></p>
