                        <h2>we're mormon. you're picturing jell-o.</h2>
                        <p>and honestly, that's fair. but here's the thing â€“ we're also people who got really, really tired of spending $50 on "miracle" skincare products that promised to change our lives and delivered... well, nothing.</p>
                        
                        <p>it started with a simple problem: our bathroom counters looked like the city creek mall, and our bank accounts looked like we'd been shopping at city creek mall. we had every trendy serum, every "game-changing" moisturizer, every product that promised to make us look like we'd been blessed by the skincare gods themselves.</p>
                        
                        <p>but here's the thing about miracles â€“ they're not real. at least not in a $50 jar of face cream.</p>
                        
                        <h3>the breaking point</h3>
                        <p>it happened on a random tuesday. i was standing in my bathroom, staring at a collection of products that cost more than my car payment, and i realized something: i was tired. tired of the promises, tired of the disappointment, tired of feeling like i needed to spend a fortune just to have skin that didn't hate me.</p>
                        
                        <p>so i did what any reasonable person would do â€“ i started making my own stuff.</p>
                        
                        <h3>the science (but not the boring kind)</h3>
                        <p>i'm not a chemist. i'm not a dermatologist. i'm just someone who got really good at reading ingredient lists and figuring out what actually works. turns out, you don't need 47 different ingredients to make something that works. you just need the right ones, in the right amounts, doing the right things.</p>
                        
                        <p>after months of testing (and a lot of friends who were very patient with my "here, try this" experiments), i figured out the perfect combination. three waxes that work together without making your face feel like a candle. real ingredients that actually do something. no miracle claims, just results.</p>
                        
                        <h3>why "not a miracle balm"?</h3>
                        <p>because we're done with the lies. we're done with products that promise to solve all your problems and then... don't. we're done with the pressure to spend your entire paycheck on something that might work, maybe, if you use it exactly right and cross your fingers and hope really hard.</p>
                        
                        <p>this is just good balm. it makes your face less annoying. that's it. that's the whole thing.</p>
                        
                        <h3>the mission</h3>
                        <p>we're not trying to revolutionize the skincare industry. we're not trying to change the world. we're just trying to make something that works, at a price that doesn't make you cry, with ingredients you can actually pronounce.</p>
                        
                        <p>we believe in honest products for real people. we believe in quality without the pretension. we believe that sometimes, the best solution is the simplest one.</p>
                        
                        <p>and we believe that your skin deserves better than empty promises and overpriced disappointment.</p>
